Build ASIC tools in a new clean chroot:

1) Run ./debootstrap.sh to create a new devuan chimaera root filesystem
(I.E. known-good reproducible build environment).

2) copy all the server scripts into the new root filesystem.

3) Run ./launch.sh to chroot into it as a simple container
(unshares all but net namespace).

4) Run build.sh to run the other scripts in sequence.
